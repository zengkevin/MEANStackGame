# Circle Programming Exercise

This code test uses the **MEAN** *(MongoDB Express.js Angular NodeJS)* stack

- Install Node.js
- Install npm
- Install MongoDB - Community Edition
- Configure the `mongod.config.yaml` file to point to the current project directory where `CodingTest_MEAN_JS` is the current folder name. Here is a sample `windows` config :
    ```
    systemLog:
        destination: file
        path: "C:\\Code\\CodingTest_MEAN_JS\\log\\mongo.log"
        logAppend: true
    storage:
        dbPath: "C:\\Code\\CodingTest_MEAN_JS\\data\\db"
        journal:
            enabled: true
    net:
        bindIp: 127.0.0.1
        port: 27017
    ```
    and a sample `mac` config : 
    ```
    systemLog:
        destination: file
        path: "/home/test/temp/cci/CodingTest_MEAN_JS/log/mongo.log"
        logAppend: true
    storage:
        dbPath: "/home/test/temp/cci/CodingTest_MEAN_JS/data/db"
        journal:
            enabled: true
    net:
        bindIp: 127.0.0.1
        port: 27017
    ``` 

- Start mongod in one terminal window with command "./path\to\mongod.exe" --config "path\to\CodingTest_MEAN_JS\mongod.config.yaml"
- call the following commands:
```
npm install
npm start
```

## Aim of test

1) First on the home page you will notice 2 buttons under the circle logo
- Only the "Play Local Game" button should be displayed if the user is not signed in
- Both buttons should be displayed when a user is signed in

2) Notice there are 2 sets of tables on the home screen
- If the user is NOT signed in, only the "Leaderboard" and "Games In Progress" should be shown
- If the user IS signed in the "Leaderboard", "Open Games" and "Games in Progress" tables should be shown

3) Click the "Play Local Game" button, your goal here is to implement the `checkForWinner()` function in the `game.local.client.controller.js` file. Check for a tic-tac-toe winner by using a [Magic Square](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MagicSquare.html)
- These games will NOT be saved on the server
- These games will NOT be posted to the leaderboard
- These games CANNOT be spectated
- Users do not need to be logged in to be able to create a local game

4) Now that you have finished the preliminary task, we can get to the meat of this problem which is
- Allow 2 logged in players to play online, this will involve
    - Creating a lobby when a logged in player clicks 'Create Online Game'
    - After this lobby is created, its information should appear in the 'Open games' List on the home page
    - When the info appears, another logged in player should click the join button, should then go from a lobby to a 'Game in Progress' and this information should appear in the appropriate list
    - Any user should be able to click 'spectate' a game in the 'Games in Progress' list and they should be able to view the game live. Spectators do not need to be able to interact.
    - When a game ends, all users should be transported back to the home page and the players game record should be saved to the leaderboard and updated live

## TECHNICAL DETAILS

1) *ALL* network communication must occur using **Websockets**

2) You will need to define database models for any persistent data i.e the **Leaderboard**, **Lobby** etc.

3) Signed in users must have the results of their games SAVED and POSTED to the home page **Leaderboard**
-  Leaderboard must be sortable by *wins*, *losses* and *draws*
-  Leaderboard must be filtered down to the top 4 users by number of wins

4) A *spectated* game is the same as a normal game except a spectator cannot interact with the game, they can only receive game updates

5) A *lobby* is a game with a single player, in a lobby the sole user cannot interact with the Leaderboard until another *player* joins.
- When a user joins a *lobby*, there should be a notification to the other members in the *lobby*

6) All games in progress must be updated On the **Games in Progress** list
- it must be sortable by *Created* time

7) All games in progress must be updated On the **Open Games** list
- it must be sortable by *Created* time

8) You will spend most of your time in the `/modules/game` directory

## HINTS

1) Look at the [Socket.io](https://socket.io/docs/) documentation with help on namespacing communication, lobbies and such

2) This program uses [Angular2](https://angular.io/docs) not AngularJS

3) This program uses [Bootstrap 4.0](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/)

4) You are free to change **anything** in the `modules/game` directory, a lot of things in this directory are boilerplate

5) You can look at the other modules to find examples of how to do some tasks
